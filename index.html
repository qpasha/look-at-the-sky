    <h1>Privacy Policy for Look at the Sky</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: April 5, 2025</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to Look at the Sky! This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our application designed to help you manage your screen time and build healthier digital habits.</p>
    <p>Our core principle is privacy-by-design. We strive to collect minimal data necessary for the app's functionality, and critically, <strong>all processing of your activity data occurs locally on your device using secure Apple services like the DeviceActivity framework.</strong> We do not have servers that collect or store your personal activity data.</p>

    <h2>Data We Collect and Why</h2>
    <p>Look at the Sky processes the following types of information, solely on your device:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Screen Time Data (via DeviceActivity API):</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>What:</strong> Information about the <strong>usage duration</strong> of specific applications that <strong>you explicitly select</strong> within the Look at the Sky app for monitoring.</li>
                <li><strong>Why:</strong> This data is essential to provide the core functionality: tracking time spent in selected apps, triggering interventions when your self-set limits are reached, and displaying usage statistics back to you.</li>
                <li><strong>Important:</strong> We only access data for apps you choose. We <strong>do not</strong> access your browsing history, content viewed, communication details, or usage data for apps you have not selected for monitoring. This processing happens <strong>locally on your device</strong> managed by Apple's secure DeviceActivity framework.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Camera Access (Temporary):</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>What:</strong> The app requests temporary access to the camera when prompting you to perform the "Look at the Sky" intervention after reaching a time limit.</li>
                <li><strong>Why:</strong> To confirm that you have taken a brief break by detecting the sky (or a bright light source).</li>
                <li><strong>Important:</strong> Image data from the camera is processed <strong>locally and in real-time</strong> on your device for the sole purpose of this confirmation. <strong>Images are not stored, saved, or transmitted off your device.</strong> Access is only requested during the intervention prompt.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Configuration Data:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>What:</strong> Information about which apps you've selected for monitoring and the time limits you've set.</li>
                <li><strong>Why:</strong> To configure the DeviceActivity framework according to your preferences.</li>
                <li><strong>Important:</strong> This data is stored <strong>locally on your device</strong> or within your secure App Group container if using app extensions, managed by the operating system.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Analytics:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>We do not collect any analytics or tracking data.</strong> Look at the Sky does not use any third-party analytics SDKs or custom tracking systems.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Your Data</h2>
    <p>As stated, data processing primarily occurs locally on your device:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To monitor usage duration for selected apps based on your limits.</li>
        <li>To trigger the "Look at the Sky" intervention prompt.</li>
        <li>To display usage statistics and estimated time saved within the app.</li>
        <li>To configure monitoring schedules via Apple's DeviceActivity framework.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We <strong>do not</strong> use your Screen Time data for advertising, profiling, or any purpose other than providing the core functionality of the app as described.</p>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We <strong>do not share</strong> your personal Screen Time data or camera images with any third parties. All sensitive data processing remains on your device.</p>
    <p>Data related to your configuration (selected apps, limits) might be shared <strong>locally</strong> between the main Look at the Sky application and its extensions (like SkyActivityMonitor) via a secure App Group container provided by Apple's operating system, solely to ensure consistent functionality across the app components.</p>

    <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>Your Screen Time data and configuration settings are stored securely <strong>on your device</strong> using standard operating system mechanisms and, where applicable, the secure App Group container.</p>
    <p>We rely on the security measures provided by Apple's iOS/iPadOS operating system and the DeviceActivity framework to protect your data locally. Camera images used for intervention confirmation are processed ephemerally and are not stored.</p>
    <p>If you delete the app, all locally stored configuration and usage data will be permanently deleted from your device.</p>

    <h2>Your Rights and Choices</h2>
    <p>You have full control over the data Look at the Sky accesses:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You choose which apps to monitor.</li>
        <li>You can grant or revoke Screen Time permission for Look at the Sky at any time in your device's Settings app (Settings > Screen Time > Look at the Sky).</li>
        <li>You can grant or revoke Camera permission at any time in your device's Settings app (Settings > Privacy & Security > Camera > Look at the Sky).</li>
        <li>You can modify or delete your configuration (monitored apps, limits) within the Look at the Sky app.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Look at the Sky is not intended for users under the age of 16 and does not offer any child-specific functionality. We do not knowingly collect or process any data from children.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any significant changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the app or on our website. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically.</p>
